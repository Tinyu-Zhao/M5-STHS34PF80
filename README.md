### SKU:U185

Contains M5Stack-**Unit TMOS PIR** related case programs.

**TMOS PIR** is a highly sensitive infrared sensor unit for presence and motion detection. It uses the STHS34PF80 chip solution. It communicates with the M5 device via I2C communication (default address: 0x5A). Its working principle is based on the blackbody radiation principle described by Planck's law, and can monitor ambient temperature and detect human presence and movement. The sensor can distinguish between stationary and moving objects and has an 80-degree field of view, providing a wide detection range. In addition, it supports adjustable sampling frequency and gain mode to adapt to different application requirements. Suitable for a variety of applications such as alarm systems, smart lighting and occupancy detection.
